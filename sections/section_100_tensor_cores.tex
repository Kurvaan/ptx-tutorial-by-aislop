\subsubsection{Tensor Cores}

As discussed in the previous section, Tensor Cores offer massive speedups for matrix operations. Ensure your workloads can leverage them when appropriate:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use supported data types (typically FP16/BF16 input)
    \item Ensure matrix dimensions are compatible with Tensor Core tile sizes
    \item Use appropriate memory layouts for maximal throughput
\end{itemize}
