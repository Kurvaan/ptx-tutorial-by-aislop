\subsubsection{Performance Impact}

In a benchmark with a typical transformer layer, fusion of the GEMM operation with GELU activation showed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Memory traffic reduction}: 33% less global memory traffic
    \item \textbf{Speed improvement}: 1.4Ã— faster execution time
    \item \textbf{Energy efficiency}: 25% reduction in power consumption
\end{itemize}

The gains were particularly significant for smaller batch sizes where the operation was more memory-bound.
