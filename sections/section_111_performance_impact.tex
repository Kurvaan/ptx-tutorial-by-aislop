\subsubsection{Performance Impact}

The custom fused attention implementation showed substantial gains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Latency reduction}: 2.3× lower latency for typical sequence lengths
    \item \textbf{Memory reduction}: 3.5× less memory traffic due to eliminated intermediate results
    \item \textbf{Scaling}: Better performance scaling with increasing sequence length
\end{itemize}

These improvements directly translated to overall model throughput improvements in transformer-based architectures like BERT and GPT.
