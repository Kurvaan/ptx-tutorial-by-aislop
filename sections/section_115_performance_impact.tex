\subsubsection{Performance Impact}

The custom quantized implementation delivered significant benefits:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Speed}: 3.7× faster than full-precision (FP16) for common matrix sizes
    \item \textbf{Memory}: 4.0× memory reduction compared to FP32, 2.0× compared to FP16
    \item \textbf{Accuracy}: Only 0.3% accuracy loss compared to FP16 for classification tasks, due to optimized per-channel scaling
\end{itemize}

This approach enabled deployment of complex transformer models on edge devices with limited memory and computational resources.
