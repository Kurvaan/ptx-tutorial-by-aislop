\subsubsection{The Challenge}

Layer normalization is a critical component in modern neural networks, especially transformers. The standard implementation involves multiple passes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute mean across features
    \item Compute variance across features
    \item Normalize and scale each feature
\end{enumerate}

This requires multiple global memory reads and writes, creating a bottleneck.
