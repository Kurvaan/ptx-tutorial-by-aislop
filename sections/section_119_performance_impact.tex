\subsubsection{Performance Impact}

The optimized layer normalization delivered:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Latency reduction}: 2.1× lower latency compared to the multi-pass approach
    \item \textbf{Memory bandwidth}: 3× reduction in global memory traffic
    \item \textbf{Integration benefits}: Better fusion opportunities with preceding operations
\end{itemize}

Given that layer normalization appears in nearly every transformer layer, this optimization had a multiplier effect on overall model performance.
