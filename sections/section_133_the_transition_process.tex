\subsection{The Transition Process}

A methodical approach to transitioning from CUDA C++ to PTX includes:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Start with a working C++ implementation} as a reference for correctness
    
    \item \textbf{Extract the PTX} from the compiled C++ code using \texttt{nvcc -ptx}
    
    \item \textbf{Study the generated PTX} to understand how the compiler mapped your algorithm
    
    \item \textbf{Make incremental changes}, testing after each modification
    
    \item \textbf{Profile both versions} to verify that your hand-tuned PTX actually improves performance
\end{enumerate}

This approach lets you learn from the compiler's decisions while gradually introducing your own optimizations.
