\section{Conclusion}

Throughout this tutorial, we've explored the world of Parallel Thread Execution (PTX) for GPU programming, with a particular focus on deep learning workloads. We've seen how PTX serves as a middle ground between high-level CUDA C++ and the actual machine instructions (SASS) executed by NVIDIA GPUs.
