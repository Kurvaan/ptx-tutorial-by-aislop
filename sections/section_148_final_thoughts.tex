\subsection{Final Thoughts}

Mastering PTX is not required for every CUDA developer, but it provides a powerful tool for performance-critical applications, especially in deep learning. Like assembly language in CPU programming, PTX gives you a window into how the hardware actually executes your code, enabling optimizations that would be difficult or impossible at higher levels of abstraction.

Whether you choose to write PTX directly, use inline PTX for specific operations, or simply inspect PTX to understand compiler behavior, the knowledge you've gained from this tutorial will help you write more efficient GPU code and make the most of NVIDIA's powerful hardware.
