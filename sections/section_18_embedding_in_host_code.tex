\subsubsection{Embedding in Host Code}

For a more integrated approach, you can embed PTX or cubin into your application as a resource and link it with your host code. NVIDIA provides tools like \texttt{fatbinary} to create object files containing both host code and device code.

This is more complex but can be managed with build systems or CUDA's own mechanisms. The CUDA runtime API can then find and load these embedded kernels automatically.

\technote{
The CUDA samples (e.g., \texttt{vectorAddDrv}) demonstrate loading a PTX module and launching a kernel via the Driver API. These examples are valuable references for understanding the mechanics of PTX execution \citep{llvm_nvptx_guide}.
