\section{Introduction to PTX and the CUDA Toolchain}

Parallel Thread Execution (PTX) is NVIDIA's low-level assembly-like language that serves as the intermediate representation for CUDA GPU computing. Understanding PTX gives developers a deeper insight into how their code executes on the GPU and opens up opportunities for advanced optimizations that may not be possible with high-level CUDA C/C++ alone.
