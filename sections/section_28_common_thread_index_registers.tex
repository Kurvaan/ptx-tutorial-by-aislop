\subsubsection{Common Thread Index Registers}

The main special registers for thread indexing are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{\%tid.x}, \texttt{\%tid.y}, \texttt{\%tid.z} - Thread index within its block (equivalent to \texttt{threadIdx} in CUDA C++)
    
    \item \texttt{\%ctaid.x}, \texttt{\%ctaid.y}, \texttt{\%ctaid.z} - Block index within the grid (equivalent to \texttt{blockIdx})
    
    \item \texttt{\%ntid.x}, \texttt{\%ntid.y}, \texttt{\%ntid.z} - Block dimensions (equivalent to \texttt{blockDim}, i.e., number of threads per block in each dimension)
    
    \item \texttt{\%nctaid.x}, \texttt{\%nctaid.y}, \texttt{\%nctaid.z} - Grid dimensions (equivalent to \texttt{gridDim}, i.e., number of blocks in the grid)
\end{itemize}
