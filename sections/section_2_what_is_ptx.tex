\subsection{What is PTX?}

PTX can be thought of as a virtual GPU assembly language—an intermediate representation that sits between your high-level CUDA code and the actual hardware instructions. When you compile a CUDA C/C++ program, the NVIDIA compiler (NVCC) first translates your device code into PTX, and then the PTX assembler (\texttt{ptxas}) converts that PTX into SASS (Streaming Assembly), which is the actual machine code for the specific GPU architecture \citep{nvidia_ptx_blog}.

This design provides several advantages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Forward Compatibility}: PTX serves as a stable programming target that can be JIT-compiled by the GPU driver to run on newer hardware that didn't exist when the application was built \citep{nvidia_ptx_blog}.
    
    \item \textbf{Abstraction Layer}: PTX abstracts some hardware details while still providing low-level control over parallelism, memory operations, and synchronization.
    
    \item \textbf{Optimization Opportunities}: By inspecting or writing PTX directly, developers can implement optimizations that might be missed by the high-level compiler.
\end{itemize}

PTX is sometimes described as "CUDA's IR" (Intermediate Representation) \citep{bruce_lee_tensor_core}. Unlike pure machine code, PTX is somewhat higher-level—it supports symbolic registers, labels, and abstracts many hardware details. For example, a single PTX \texttt{add.f32} instruction may map to different actual instructions depending on the GPU generation.
