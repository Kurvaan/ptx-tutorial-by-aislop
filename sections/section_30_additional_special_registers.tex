\subsubsection{Additional Special Registers}

PTX provides other special registers for advanced thread management:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{\%laneid} - The thread's index within its warp (0-31), useful for warp-synchronous programming
    
    \item \texttt{\%warpid} - The warp's index within the block
    
    \item \texttt{\%nwarpid} - Number of warps per block
    
    \item \texttt{\%smid} - SM identifier executing the thread
    
    \item \texttt{\%lanemask\_lt}, \texttt{\%lanemask\_le}, etc. - Masks for threads with lane IDs less than, less than or equal to, etc., the current thread
\end{itemize}

These are particularly useful for implementing warp-level optimizations, where threads in the same warp cooperate on a computation.
