\subsubsection{Vector Operations}

PTX supports vectorized operations for memory access and some arithmetic:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=ptx]
ld.global.v4.f32 {%f0, %f1, %f2, %f3}, [%rd1];  // Load 4 floats at once
st.global.v2.f32 [%rd2], {%f0, %f1};           // Store 2 floats at once
\end{lstlisting}

Vector operations can improve memory bandwidth utilization and arithmetic throughput. However, they require proper alignmentâ€”for example, a \texttt{v4.f32} load requires 16-byte alignment of the memory address.
