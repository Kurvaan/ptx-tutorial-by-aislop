\subsubsection{Memory Caching and Control}

PTX gives some control over the caching behavior of global memory operations. For example:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=ptx]
// Cache at global level only
ld.global.cg.f32 %f1, [%rd1];

// Cache at all levels
ld.global.ca.f32 %f1, [%rd1];

// Specify cache line size (Ampere+)
ld.global.L2::128B.f32 %f1, [%rd1];
\end{lstlisting}

Advanced usage can include prefetch or asynchronous load instructions for overlapping memory transfer with computation. For instance, Ampere architecture introduced \texttt{cp.async} instructions to asynchronously copy from global to shared memory:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=ptx]
// Asynchronously copy 16 bytes from global to shared memory
cp.async.ca.shared.global [%rd_shared], [%rd_global], 16;
\end{lstlisting}

Such features can greatly improve performance in memory-bound kernels but may require specific hardware support.
