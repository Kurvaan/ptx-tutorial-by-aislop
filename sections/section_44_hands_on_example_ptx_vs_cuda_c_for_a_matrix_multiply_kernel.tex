\section{Hands-On Example: PTX vs. CUDA C++ for a Matrix Multiply Kernel}

To illustrate the process of developing and optimizing in PTX, let's implement a matrix multiplication kernelâ€”a core operation in deep learning for computing fully-connected layer outputs, attention mechanisms, and other operations. We'll compare a straightforward CUDA C++ implementation with an optimized PTX version.
