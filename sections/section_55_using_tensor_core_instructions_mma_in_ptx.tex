\section{Using Tensor Core Instructions (MMA) in PTX}

Modern NVIDIA GPUs (Volta and later) include specialized hardware units called Tensor Cores, which dramatically accelerate matrix multiplication operations. These units are particularly valuable for deep learning workloads, where matrix multiplication is a dominant computation. In this section, we'll explore how to leverage Tensor Cores directly through PTX.
