\section{Inspecting PTX from CUDA C/C++ Code}

Before diving into writing PTX from scratch, it's instructive to examine what PTX the compiler generates from simple CUDA kernels. This provides insight into PTX syntax and helps verify what high-level code actually translates to at the intermediate level.
