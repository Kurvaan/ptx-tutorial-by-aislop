\subsection{Loading Matrix Fragments}

A critical aspect of using Tensor Cores efficiently is properly loading the matrix fragments. This typically involves:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Loading data from global memory into shared memory in a coalesced pattern
    \item Organizing data in shared memory to match the fragment layout expected by Tensor Cores
    \item Transferring data from shared memory to registers in the correct arrangement
\end{enumerate}

Starting with Ampere GPUs, PTX provides specialized instructions to help with this process, such as \texttt{ldmatrix}:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=ptx]
// Load a 16x8 F16 matrix fragment from shared memory
ldmatrix.sync.aligned.m8n8.x4.shared.b16 {%A0,%A1,%A2,%A3}, [%sharedMemAddr];
\end{lstlisting}

This instruction loads a matrix fragment from shared memory directly into the registers, handling the complex distribution of elements among threads in the warp automatically.
