\subsubsection{Interactive Profiling with the GUI}

The GUI version (nsight-compute) provides a more interactive experience:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
nsight-compute ./myprogram
\end{lstlisting}

This launches the Nsight Compute GUI, which allows you to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Run the application and collect detailed metrics
    \item Explore performance bottlenecks through various analysis views
    \item Compare performance across different kernel implementations
    \item Examine PTX and SASS code alongside performance data
\end{itemize}
