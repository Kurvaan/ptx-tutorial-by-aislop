\subsubsection{PTX/SASS Correlation}

One of the most valuable features of Nsight Compute for PTX development is the **Source/PTX/SASS correlation view**. This view shows your source code (or PTX) alongside the compiled SASS instructions, with metrics for each line.

To use this feature:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compile with lineinfo to preserve the mapping between source and assembly:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
    nvcc --keep --source-in-ptx -lineinfo myprogram.cu
    \end{lstlisting}
    
    \item Profile the application in Nsight Compute
    
    \item Open the "Source" tab in the results
    
    \item Select the desired view (Source, PTX, or SASS) and metrics
\end{enumerate}

This view shows which instructions are causing stalls or executing inefficiently, helping you pinpoint exactly where to optimize your PTX code.
