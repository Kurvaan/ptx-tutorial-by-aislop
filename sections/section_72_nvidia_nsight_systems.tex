\subsection{NVIDIA Nsight Systems}

While Nsight Compute focuses on individual kernels, Nsight Systems provides a system-wide view of application performance, including CPU-GPU interaction, memory transfers, and kernel execution timeline.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
nsys profile ./myprogram
\end{lstlisting}

This generates a report showing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Timeline of CPU and GPU activities
    \item Kernel launches and durations
    \item Memory operations between host and device
    \item CUDA API calls
\end{itemize}

Nsight Systems helps identify system-level bottlenecks, such as insufficient CPU-GPU parallelism or excessive memory transfers, which might impact the overall performance even if individual kernels are well-optimized.
