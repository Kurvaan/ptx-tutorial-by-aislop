\subsubsection{cuobjdump}

The `cuobjdump` tool extracts PTX or SASS from CUDA binaries:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
cuobjdump -ptx myprogram      # Extract PTX
cuobjdump -sass myprogram     # Extract SASS
\end{lstlisting}

This is useful for examining what's inside a pre-built application or library, or verifying that your PTX was assembled as expected.
