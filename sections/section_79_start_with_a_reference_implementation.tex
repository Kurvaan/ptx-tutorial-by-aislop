\subsection{Start with a Reference Implementation}

Before diving into PTX coding, it's valuable to have a working high-level implementation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Begin with a CUDA C++ version to establish correctness and serve as a baseline
    \item Generate PTX from this implementation to understand the compiler's approach
    \item Identify portions that could benefit from manual optimization
\end{itemize}

This way, you can focus your PTX optimization efforts on the most critical parts while having a correct reference to validate against.
