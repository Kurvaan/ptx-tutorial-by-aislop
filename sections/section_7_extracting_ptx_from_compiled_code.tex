\subsection{Extracting PTX from Compiled Code}

If you have an already compiled executable or library that contains embedded PTX and cubin code, you can extract the PTX using the CUDA Binary Utilities:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
cuobjdump -ptx myprogram
\end{lstlisting}

This will dump any PTX embedded in \texttt{myprogram}'s CUDA binaries \citep{nvidia_cuda_binary}. This approach is useful if you want to examine the PTX for kernels in pre-built applications or libraries, such as deep learning frameworks.

Additionally, you can use \texttt{cuobjdump -sass} to dump the SASS (machine code) for comparison:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
cuobjdump -sass myprogram
\end{lstlisting}

Comparing PTX with SASS can reveal how the assembler transforms your intermediate code into actual hardware instructions.
