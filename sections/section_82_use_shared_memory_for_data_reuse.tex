\subsubsection{Use Shared Memory for Data Reuse}

Shared memory is much faster than global memory for data that will be accessed multiple times:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=ptx]
// Declare shared memory
.shared .align 4 .b32 sharedData[256];

// Load from global to shared (coalesced access)
// ... compute shared memory address
ld.global.f32 %f1, [%rd_global];
st.shared.f32 [%rd_shared], %f1;

// Synchronize
bar.sync 0;

// Now multiple threads can reuse this data from shared memory
// ... compute shared addresses for different access patterns
ld.shared.f32 %f2, [%rd_shared_access1];
ld.shared.f32 %f3, [%rd_shared_access2];
\end{lstlisting}

This is especially important for operations like convolutions and matrix multiplications, where each input element is used in multiple output calculations.
