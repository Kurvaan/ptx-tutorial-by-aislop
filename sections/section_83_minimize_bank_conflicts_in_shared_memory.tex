\subsubsection{Minimize Bank Conflicts in Shared Memory}

Shared memory is divided into banks (typically 32 banks on modern GPUs). If multiple threads in a warp access the same bank, those accesses are serialized, reducing performance.

Common techniques to avoid bank conflicts include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Padding arrays (adding an extra element between rows)
    \item Using transposition during loads to change access patterns
    \item Carefully designing data layouts to ensure threads access different banks
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=ptx]
// Example: Padding to avoid bank conflicts
// Instead of a 32x32 array, use 33x32 with one element of padding per row
.shared .align 4 .b32 sharedData[33*32];

// When accessing row i, column j:
// Address = i*33 + j instead of i*32 + j
\end{lstlisting}
