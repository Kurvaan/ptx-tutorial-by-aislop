\subsubsection{Monitor Register Count}

Use `ptxas -v` to track how many registers your kernel uses:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
ptxas -v mykernel.ptx
# Output: ptxas info: Used 32 registers, 0 bytes spill stores...
\end{lstlisting}

The register count directly impacts how many warps can run concurrently on each SM. Lower register usage generally allows higher occupancy, which can help hide memory and instruction latency.
