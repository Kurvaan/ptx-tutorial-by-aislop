\subsubsection{Avoid Register Spilling}

If your kernel uses more registers than available per thread, the excess variables "spill" to local memory (which is much slower):

\begin{itemize}
    \item Look for `spill stores` and `spill loads` in the `ptxas` output
    \item If spills occur, try to reduce the number of live variables or restructure the code
    \item Consider reusing registers when variables are no longer needed
\end{itemize}
