\subsubsection{Use Texture Memory for Read-Only Data with Spatial Locality}

Texture memory provides caching optimized for 2D spatial locality, which can be beneficial for operations like convolutions:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=ptx]
// Texture load example
tex.2d.v4.f32.f32 {%f1, %f2, %f3, %f4}, [%tex_reference, {%f5, %f6}];
\end{lstlisting}

Though texture usage in PTX is complex, it can provide significant benefits for certain access patterns.
