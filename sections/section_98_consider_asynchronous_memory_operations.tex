\subsubsection{Consider Asynchronous Memory Operations}

On Ampere and newer architectures, asynchronous copy operations can overlap data movement with computation:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=ptx]
// Asynchronous copy from global to shared memory
cp.async.cg.shared.global [%rd_shared], [%rd_global], 16;

// Continue computing while the copy happens

// Synchronize to ensure copy completion
cp.async.commit_group;
cp.async.wait_group 0;
\end{lstlisting}

This technique is particularly powerful for operations with regular memory access patterns like matrix multiplication.
